1. You don't have to use .Equals for objects in C#
2. Instead of doing new Color(255, 255, 255) just use Color.White since it's easier to read.
3. If you use a color that isn't just Color.White, Color.Red, etc, define a variable for it so we know what color it is
    so do like static readonly Color DARKPURPLE = new Color(100, 0, 50) or whatever
