Overall I think the code is rather clean. It seems 
short and simple since it is the top of the hirearchy excluding the main game. 
The only thing I would change is by adding comments to explain what things do 
instead of haveing to open all the diffrent files. I have noticed this with all the code mine included. 
It just seems require more time to sort through everything.
