This is less of a review of code and more of a review on how the game feels to play, which
I feel is quite important, although none of these are too big a deal.

Mario carries no momentum to his movement, stoping as soon as the key is released.
This can feel a little weird and might make platforming too easy.

Mario's jump is just a little bit high. Maybe lower it a tad. Maybe also implement differing
jump heights based on button hold time. In particular, the jump off of enemies should be lower
so it's more difficult to get the multistomp combo thing.

Coins just come out of blocks, but they should be auto collected.

In the second half of the level, everything's just a little bit too high.

Mario immediately switching power-up states also feels weird. Should have some transition time.

All blocks except used blocks should bounce. Right now, only bricks bounce.
