Overall I think the conversion from having to use the Monogame content pipeline to useing only c# things was genious. 
Also throwing out the old parser and dimplifiying it was very good as well. 
One of the only major concerns I have is that you open files and you never close them. This can be a major Issue with the reset function we are implementing. 
I did go ahead and fix this problem by closing the file after getting all the data we needed from it. 
I also think it was a great idea to make the spawn function generic to allow 1 function to be used for all the maps we layer in. 
Overall I think it is much cleaner than the previous parser. Great job.
