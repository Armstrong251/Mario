In general, the code in BackgroundLayer.cs is great. The code inside that method is concise and efficient. I mainly want to talk about how
BackgroundLayer.cs is used in other files. For one thing, all the backgrounds are added in at the MarioGame.cs and not through Level.cs or
by parsing a file. I understand why as this was added in a bit of a time crunch. We may want to either add a level config xml file, or update
the parser to take in fields like level theme and background via the png files. This will make it easier in the future to change the background
or theme. In addition, the backgound looks strange over jumps, as there is just blue for anything below 2 blocks. This might make people think
there is water or destroy their immersion in the game. To fix this we could adjust the background to account for gaps, add a dirt/floor 
background for below level 2, or we could add visible but non - interactable blocks for those locations. The last one could struggle, if Mario
goes behind the blocks, or if the blocks arent clearly defined as being unable to land on. Overall, though the file itself looks great! Just
keep these things in mind as you move forward.
