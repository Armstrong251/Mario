1 - facingRight should be a part of MarioContext since it's state-independent

2 - Since Mario will never need 2 of the same state, all the states can be in a static factory
	to avoid having to make a new one each time

2.5 - Look at what Rider did for block states in Block.cs

3 - alternatively for point 2: instantiation might be good because it lets a state know when it starts

4 - animations should go in a factory class

5 - it's a pretty large file and it's only going to get larger, consider splitting it up

6 - There's ways to make it so that crouching state/jumping state are separate from power-up state
	so that you don't have to have a separate class for each permutation - consider doing that
	to avoid code reuse.
