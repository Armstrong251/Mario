This review to 30 minutes.

Overall, the quality of the code here is good, especially in the fact that is generic, using an abstract
class to accomplish this.

The use of the ControllerManger class makes it a little confusing to navigate and I'm not sure how having it
helps versus justconsolidating the functionality into one location.

Also, the class makes use of an event system rather than using the Command Pattern, which is perfecly fine, as
it seems to accomplish a similar effect.

As for changes, I see no need to change anything yet, as it seems to be working just fine.
