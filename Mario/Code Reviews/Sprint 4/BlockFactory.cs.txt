The way that themes are implemented right now results in a lot of extra code compared to what I feel is strictly necessary.

The fact that all of the cases are duplicated and the new locations of things are manually calculated means that there's a lot of code.

Possible ways to remedy this:
    * Have each theme be an integer offset - for instance, the overworld brick block and the cave brick block are exactly 64 pixels apart, 
            the overworld and cave used block are also 64 pixels apart, etc
    * Have each theme be a separate file where all the coordinates are the same

As it is now, it's a bit hard to read.
