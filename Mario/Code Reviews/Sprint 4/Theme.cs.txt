Time Taken to Review: 10 minutes

First off, yes I am reviewing my own code.

So right now, Theme covers only the background elements of a level, but the actual theme covers more than that.
To go along with the changes in BlockFactory, Themes should have the information that will let the correctly themed
sprite to be constructed. Additionally, music and other properties of the level should stored here.
It may also be safe to register themes during construction, removing the need for the Register method.
Also, because this was hastily added to fix a background issue, there's not much consistency with it's use in the code.
Some places use the class, some places use a string. It should consistently use the class.
