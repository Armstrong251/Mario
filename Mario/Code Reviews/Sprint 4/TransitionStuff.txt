I found that the classes within the 2 files do preform the intended tasks. I would make some refactoring changes in the future thoug
Overall I think the start screen should be formated so it works with any screen size. This will allow a full screen implimentation. 
The transitions in Game over seem to be working properly. The code overall seems rather clean and consise. We should change the name of the file 
GameOver.cs to maybe flashScreens.cs to encourperate all screeens used in transitions.
