Reviewing: Levels

Time Taken: 10 minutes.

I feel the level definitions are pretty on par. The idea of actualy having worlds instead of just liniar leveles 
is more true to mario. Also The design of of the boss fights is also great and true to mario. The idea of the axe bridge is well designed. 
The custom space theme is a very nice touch and adds a new flaver to mario. I also think there was a good representation 
of the diffrent mobs. The only change I would make: Up the dificulty. Personaly I like hard games but, maybe that is just
my bias
