How to Edit the Map

The contents of the map displayed, during the game are created through the information provided in four files.
Below are the descriptions of what each file does.
All the files should be the same dimensions. If they are not the same dimensions there will be issues.
I suggest using an image editing software that provides layers, to easily line up the images and ensure they are the same size.
Create a base layer that is white.
Create 4 layers 1 for each future png file.
Edit those layers to create the map you want.
After checking that it is correct export the image.

All of the available colors for the pictures are provided below. 
While white is preferred for air any color not listed in the sections below is read in, it will also be displayed as air.

WHITE = RGB(255, 255, 255)
RED = RGB(255, 0, 0)
ORANGE = RGB(255, 135, 0)
YELLOW = RGB(255, 255, 0)
BROWN = RGB(200, 135, 75)
CYAN = RGB(0, 255, 255)
GREEN = RGB(0, 255, 0)
BLACK = RGB(0, 0, 0)

CPMap.png
Contains the locations of the coins and power ups at the start of the game.
WHITE = air
ORANGE = fire flower
RED = super mushroom
GREEN = one up mushroom
CYAN = star
YELLOW = coin in air
For in blocks the power ups are the same, but the number of coins is determined by its B value 
R and G values are set to 255.
255 255 0 is 10
255 255 180 is 1
255 255 160 is 2
255 255 140 is 3 ect.
Neither power ups or coins in blocks has been implemented, because those were not neccessary for this sprint.
